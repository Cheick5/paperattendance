A little bit of documentation about paper I wrote for myself

First beware: understand the difference between sessions, modules and attendances.
A session is a single class, a class in theory can span through multiple modules.
An attendance (or presence) is a single student going (or not) to a single module of a single session. Each attendance gets an OmegaID when synced which is used to update the attendance later if needed.

===================================
WORKFLOW
The secretaries print all PDFs for the day, they give the relevant pages to each teacher.
The teacher then fills the pages and at the end of the day hands the pages back to the secretaries.
The secretaries scan all the pages and make huge PDFs they scan and upload to paper
Paper scans and processes the PDFs, and then syncs everything with Omega

===================================
PAGES

-attendance.php: to pass online attendance
-discussion.php: For students to discussion their (in)assistances and teachers to close the discussion?
-export.php: probably to export the history attendances as excel
-history.php: to see the sessions and the assistances in each session, also shows if sync with omega
-lib.php: a moodle function to handle files apparently
-locallib.php: A lot of functions used everywhere
-missingpages.php: shows the missing pages and manually processing them
-modules.php: to edit the time modules
-print.php: for printing pdfs for a single class
-printsearch.php: for printing multiple pdfs for multiple classes
-quickprint.php: server side for printsearch, sends a pdf for all modules of a class in the day
-carprint.php: server side for printsearch.php, it sends a pdf for the classes and modules selected
-summary.php: ???
-settings.php: the settings, ex: the max time for a student to come late (I dont know where that setting is used though), configurable through Site Administration->Plugins->Local Plugins->PaperAttendance
-upload.php: upload a PDF after being filled in class

===================================
OMEGA 

Omega has 3 functions to communicate with Paperattendance
-Create attendance, which creates a session and sends the attendances of all the students in multiple modules, then returns an id per attendance
(this function is mostly the paperattendance_omegacreateattendance in locallib.php)
-Update attendance, which using the id that omega returned with create attendance to update a single user attendance, it seems it can also be used to create a single attendance
-Get modulos, this one reads the modules from a class to preselect modules when the teacher is going to create a print

====================================
AJAX FUNCTIONS:

1: Get Modulos horarios (curlgetmoduloshorario)
This functions pulls the time modules from omega

2: Get courses (getcourses), used in printsearch
This function doesnt even read any data from omega, it just reads from the DB
It returns the courses available to the user?
I think this is for the separate printing that is done in production

3: Cart List (cartlist), used in printsearch
This one actually communicates with Omega, I dont really care why though.
By the name it looks like its to be able to select multiple courses to print at once

4: Get list of Students in page (getliststudentspage), used in missingpages to get the students in a page
It reads the DB to see which page it is and returns all the students in it so that the teacher can manually mark presence.

5: Change Student Presence (changestudentpresence), used in history.php to change the presence of a single student
it updates the db and omega at the same time
this is probably one of the most important functions

6: Save students attendance (savestudentsattendance), used in missingpages to save multiple students presence.
at first glance it only updates the DB but its so wildly complicated that it probably does something else

7: Check progress page (checkprocesspage), used in missingpages.php for something?
I think this reads the db to see if a page was processed or not, regarldess its not very important

8: Change all presence (changeallpresence), used in history.php for changing multiple students at once and syncing with Omega

9: Save insert student (saveinsertstudent), used in history.php 
It saves an array of students to the db and then syncs them to omega

====================================
TASKS:

There are 4 tasks, 3 are scheduled tasks which run at specified times, 1 is an ad-hoc task that is queued from the code.
-cleantemp.php, deletes everything in the print and unread/jpgs folder.
-omegasync.php, syncs unsynced courses and students
-presence.php, unkown, probably something to do with insert students?
-processpdf.php, the only ad-hoc task, is queued on upload.php when a pdf is uploaded. It is run the next time the moodle cron is executed, it processes uploaded pdfs, scanning and registering everything.

To run the scheduled tasks configure moodle to allow to run the tasks from the web interface, to run processpdf upload a pdf and either run the moodle cron with php (moodle/admin/cli/cron.php) or run it through the browser (http://$url/admin/cron.php)
