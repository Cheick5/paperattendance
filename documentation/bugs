-if printed list has more dots than students history bugs out and thinks the session is sincronized with omega (minor, ignore)
-somehow some students have negative absences, probably something to do with online assistance (this allows students to have over 100% assistance). It appear to have something to do when online assistance and printed assistance overlap (printed first, online second)
-If you process a printed list and then pass online attendance for the same module double presences are stored, if you pass online atendance first the print will refuse to process. Do the same with online attendances
-Missing pages: sometimes continue button does nothing (only happens in local)
-[DONE] History doesnt show all sessions (this only happens if the module the session was in is deleted)


Lots of bugs in history and attendance.php, rework them
Everything else at least looks stable
Some redesigning on the db couldnt do any wrong, but I fear adding any foreign key will bring the entire thing down burning because of inconsistencies
